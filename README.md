**Stock Market Prediction Project**
**Overview**
This repository contains the code and resources for a stock market prediction project.
The project aims to predict stock prices using machine learning models and analyze various aspects of stock market data to make informed investment decisions.

**Project Structure**
Data: Contains the dataset of TCS from 2019 used for training and testing the models.
Notebooks: Jupyter notebooks with the code for data preprocessing, model training, and analysis.
Models: Saved trained models for predicting stock prices.
Reports: Reports and summaries of the project findings and analysis.
**Key Features**
Utilizes machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest and Gradient Boosting for stock price prediction.
Implements technical indicators and statistical methods for risk management and portfolio optimization.
Conducts exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand patterns and trends in the stock market data.
Backtests trading strategies and evaluates their performance using historical data.
